## About the Game

In this game you need to match pairs of cards. Playing is very simple - you turn over one tile and then try to find a matching one. There are 16 cards and therefore 8 pairs on the deck. 

Your result depends on how fast you find all the pairs (the timer) and how many moves you've done. The less, the better. 

## Instructions
* Click on a card
* Turn second card and keep looking for the right pair if they do not match.
* Try to finish game as fast as possible and with minimum moves.
